# Web_Scraping_with_Selenium

## Overview :
This repository contains a collection of real-world examples demonstrating web scraping using Python with Selenium. 
Most of these scripts were created to assist the community on Stack Overflow by providing fully functional solutions to their questions.

## Script Naming Convention :
The scripts are named based on the websites they target for scraping. 
For instance, a script designed to scrape data from `https://www.abcd.co.ef/editorial/` is named `abcd_co_ef.py`. 
This naming convention makes it easy to identify the source website for each script.

## Stack Overflow References : 
The scripts also include references to the corresponding Stack Overflow questions. 
This allows you to easily access the original discussions and gain background knowledge about the problems being addressed.
